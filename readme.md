Password cracking is the process of guessing or recovering a password from stored locations or from data transmission system. 
It is used to get a password for unauthorized access or to recover a forgotten password. In penetration testing, it is used to check the security of an application.
Our tool focuses on password cracking for all. Using this tool we can perform number of operations which includes brute force , dictionary attacks , rainbow tables and hashing. This tool provides number of features at one place.
Our tool is very efficient to use and provides almost all the features provided by the premium tools.
Many people feel helpless when they are in need of such facilities such as forgot password, training purposes etc.
This tool provides them the platform to work freely without any hesitation.  
The brute force solution makes you really understand the problem without worrying about optimizing your solution. We know what our input will be and exactly how it needs to be modified to get to the output. Once we have a brute force solution, we can use many different techniques to improve our time and space complexity.
Our tool also provides the rainbow tables which are usually used for cracking password hashes. These tables are usually used in recovering a password up to certain length consisting of a limited set of characters.
Our too provides one of the important feature of hashing which can be used to check file authenticity , to generate rainbow tables , etc. A hash value can be used to uniquely identify secret information. Hash functions are widely used in cryptography. 
Our tool will get improve and provide you with more features which includes like more characters , advanced brute force attacks , more easy and efficient password cracking techniques , etc.
